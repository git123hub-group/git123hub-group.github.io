* Wall # 0 (identifier: DEFAULT_WL_ERASE) usage:
  Eraser. Erases walls.

* Wall # 1 (identifier: DEFAULT_WL_CNDTW) usage:
  Conductive Wall. Blocks everything. Conductive.
  Special: Conducts SPRK to anything conductive.

* Wall # 2 (identifier: DEFAULT_WL_EWALL) usage:
  E-Wall. Becomes transparent when electricity is connected.
  Special: Acts like WALL (Non conductive) when not electrified, otherwise acts like Conductor.

* Wall # 3 (identifier: DEFAULT_WL_DTECT) usage:
  Detector. Generates electricity when a particle is inside.
  Special: Will pass SPRK on to anything conductive while a particle is in its area. When activated, it gives out a orange glow.

* Wall # 4 (identifier: DEFAULT_WL_STRM) usage:
  Streamline. Set start point of a streamline.
  Special: Shows you how pressure is moving around the simulation. Unlike other walls, the brush size doesn't matter.

* Wall # 5 (identifier: DEFAULT_WL_FAN) usage:
  Fan. Accelerates Air. Use the line tool to set direction and strength.
  Special:
    Creates pressure and airflow. To use, place the wall where you need it, while you still have the Fan wall selected hold shift,
    click on the wall then drag in the direction you want air to flow.
    Fan gives stickmen the ability to shoot out air, just like it would an element. Its head will turn light blue, and it will get
    overridden by any other element it touches.

* Wall # 6 (identifier: DEFAULT_WL_LIQD) usage:
  Liquid Permeable.
  Blocks most particles but lets liquids through. Conductive.
  Special: Conducts SPRK to anything conductive.

* Wall # 7 (identifier: DEFAULT_WL_ABSRB) usage:
  Absorbing wall. Absorbs particles but lets air currents through.
  Special:
    Absorbs all particles that enter its space. However, if the particle has a vector speed (X) and the thickness is less than X,
    the particles will pass.

* Wall # 8 (identifier: DEFAULT_WL_WALL) usage:
  Basic wall, blocks everything.

* Wall # 9 (identifier: DEFAULT_WL_AIR) usage:
  Non-permeable wall. Allows air, but blocks all particles.

* Wall # 10 (identifier: DEFAULT_WL_POWDR) usage:
  Powder Permeable. Allows powders, blocks all other particles.

* Wall # 11 (identifier: DEFAULT_WL_CNDTR) usage:
  Conductor. Allows all particles to pass through and conducts electricity.
  Special: Conducts SPRK to anything conductive.

* Wall # 12 (identifier: DEFAULT_WL_EHOLE) usage:
  E-Hole. Absorbs particles, releases them when powered.
  Special:
    Holds particles in place until electrified, releases them when electrified. Forms Black Holes when too much mass is put
    into it. Each pixel of E-Hole can have up to 1500 parts in it before it forms Black Hole. E-Hole will also remove jetpacks
    from stickmen or fighters.
  
* Wall # 13 (identifier: DEFAULT_WL_GAS) usage:
  Gas permeable wall. Allows gases (include <span class="red">FIRE</span>), blocks all other particles.

* Wall # 14 (identifier: DEFAULT_WL_GRVTY) usage:
  Gravity wall. Newtonian Gravity has no effect inside a box drawn with this.
  Special:
    If you make a box using gravity wall, then Newtonian gravity has no effect inside the box. It does not block how things like
    pressure are blocked, it just sets the gravity of all things inside the box to 0.
    When a stickman/fighter makes contact, small purple rocket boots appear (Or what others call jetpacks), giving that person the
    ability to fly by ejecting hot plasma downwards. A stickman can still use another element, but cannot walk or jump without
    creating plasma, making troublesome to walk across flammable materials. A stickman cannot be hurt by plasma when it has a jet-
    pack on, but will still be hurt by heat.

      &lt;&gt; simultaneously held down: Brake (Slowly goes down)

* Wall # 15 (identifier: DEFAULT_WL_ENRGY) usage:
  Energy Wall. Allows energy particles, blocks all other particles.

* Wall # 16 (identifier: DEFAULT_WL_NOAIR) usage:
  Air-block Wall. Allows all particles, but blocks air.

* Wall # 17 (identifier: DEFAULT_WL_ERASEA) usage:
  Erase All. Erases walls, particles, and signs.

* Wall # 18 (identifier: DEFAULT_WL_BRWALL) usage:
  Breakable wall, but allows air.

* Wall # 255 (C++ define from: WL_FLOODHELPER) usage:
  Use by fan flood fill helper
